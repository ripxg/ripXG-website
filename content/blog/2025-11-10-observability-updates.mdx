It's been a little over a month since my last update but the chatter in this space has been **sky high** following high-profile incidents at AWS and Cloudflare. Really good to see both publish strong postmortems, in case you missed them.

## Recent Conversation Topics

The conversations at various levels in the last month have still been focused on:

- **Business Workflow/Journey monitoring**
- **Agentic Troubleshooting** (Splunk Alpha version)
- **Observability for AI Workloads**

Many customers are starting to use **OOTB dashboards** for their AI infrastructure and LLM-based apps, with OpenLLMetry (https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry) and I've been assisting quite a few get started here (without spending too much time or effort, that's the key).

Whether you are using the Cisco AI pods, another commercial solution or have built your own tech stack for AI apps, consider how you'll integrate into your existing Observability solutions.

## State of Observability 2025

I've had a skim of the recently published **"State of Observability 2025"** at: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/campaigns/state-of-observability.html

There are some great insights in the report, like this table of Observability capabilities to the business, ranked by importance:

### The Missing Priorities

I find it interesting as most conversations I've had in the last month centre around **AI for Observability** and **Observability for AI** (what's the difference between these?), but have often missed the top two in this list:

- **Detecting application security vulnerabilities**
- **Monitoring critical business processes**

> If you find that the business is struggling to support Observability initiatives, bring these capabilities to the front and centre.

## How Splunk Addresses These Priorities

The way Splunk addresses these is relatively straightforward and mature. Let me know if you'd like to dive into either of these:

### Application Runtime Vulnerability Detection with SecureApp

Lighten workload for application teams by providing direct visibility into runtime exploitable vulnerabilities and automatically mapping them to their corresponding application services. This allows teams to proactively address critical risks and safely de-prioritize non-exploitable ones.

**Detect application vulnerabilities in real-time**

### Monitor Critical Business Processes with APM/AIOPs

Provide real-time visibility into how application performance impacts business outcomes. Use dynamic baselining, business journey mapping, and segment health insights to prioritize troubleshooting.

**Business process monitoring from RUM/APM data**

## November Feature Updates

You can check my [last post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/october-observability-updates-sremonitoring-teams-jeff-chau-00xcc?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) in this series in October, where I highlight many of the Alpha/Preview features of last month.

> Huge kudos to the Splunk product teams cooking up a storm, bringing many of these into General Availability.
