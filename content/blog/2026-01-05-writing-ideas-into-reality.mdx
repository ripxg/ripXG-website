This year I&#8217;m committing to writing.

Not as a New Year&#8217;s resolution, but for life.

Why?

Because writing is one of the few ways I believe anyone can advance how they think.

For me, it’s how ideas that would otherwise sit unexplored in the corners of my mind become something real.

Writing forces those ideas to take shape. It gives them structure, clarity, and momentum.

Secondly, writing is how ideas scale.

Most ideas never reach beyond the people we can speak to directly. That matters, because even the most useful ideas only have value if they reach the right people.

If I can encourage even a few of you to do the same, it will be worth it.

Thirdly, in the age of AI, the potential of text is incredible. I can take anything I’ve written and question it, reflect on it from a third-person perspective, or even transform it into something entirely different.

AI is like a supercharged magic mirror &#8211; beyond just a reflection &#8211; a mirror that shapes you into who you are becoming.
