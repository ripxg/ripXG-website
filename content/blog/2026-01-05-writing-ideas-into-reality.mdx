This year I'm committing to writing.

Not as a New Year's resolution, but **for life**.

## Why Write?

Because writing is one of the few ways I believe anyone can advance how they think.

For me, it's how ideas that would otherwise sit unexplored in the corners of my mind become something real.

> Writing forces those ideas to take shape. It gives them structure, clarity, and momentum.

## Ideas Need to Scale

Secondly, writing is **how ideas scale**.

Most ideas never reach beyond the people we can speak to directly. That matters, because even the most useful ideas only have value if they reach the right people.

If I can encourage even a few of you to do the same, it will be worth it.

## The AI Amplifier

Thirdly, in the age of AI, the potential of text is incredible. I can take anything I've written and question it, reflect on it from a third-person perspective, or even transform it into something entirely different.

> AI is like a supercharged magic mirror—beyond just a reflection—a mirror that shapes you into who you are becoming.
